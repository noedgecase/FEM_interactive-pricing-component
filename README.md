## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.


## Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month / 2 / $72 per year
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month / 3 / $108 per year
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month / 4 / $144 per year
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month / 6 / $216 per year
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month / 9 / $324 per year

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
